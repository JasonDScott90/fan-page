Gwyndolin's followers are few, but their tasks are of vital importance. Although born male, due to magic and association with the moon, Gwyndolin was raised as a daughter. Gwyndolin is biologically a male and is referred to as male by Gwynevere, who lovingly calls him brother. Gwyndolin created the illusion of a sister Gwynevere to help guard over Anor Londo. An unmasking of these deities would be tantamount to blasphemy.</td>
